Starting this project today. Going to use a mix of technologies. The purpose of the site is to have all of your dispersed camping needs under one roof. From location to weather to camping neccessities. 

I will be using JS, Express, ejs, mocha, node and chai. Well here goes nothing.

Rouuuuugh day today. Had a bug that I couldn't find that took up most of the day. Was able to finally find it and move on but not before I was burnt out! 

I was able to add a first name and last name to the data base and have the login have the users name next to it.

Moving on to work on the camp sites. Will try to incorporate the API into it as well.
